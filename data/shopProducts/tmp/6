Hue (65) grey green,shift shirt <p>The grey-green Hue shirt dress is a feminine take on a classic style, cut to a loose-fitting silhouette and detailed with a small chain embellishment at the neckline. Wear it with ankle boots and add a slouchy leather tote for a sophisticated take on 18-hour style.</p>

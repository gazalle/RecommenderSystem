Mari (52) black,cross-back maxi <p>The Mari maxi dress is proof that you can wear black in summer months. It's cut to a striking full-length silhouette with a handkerchief hem and statement crossover back straps. Wear it with open-toe flats and add a striking red lip or style it with a block-heel sandal for a more dressed-up approach.</p>

Adie (23) night navy,roll-neck shift <p>The Piera sandals are crafted from panels of brightly-coloured elaphe radiata snakeskin. The open-toe design is perfect for summer and the high block heel makes them a wearable choice for SS17. Style them with block-colour separates to inject your look with a pop of colour. Due to the nature of the snakeskin, variances in shoes may differ slightly from those pictured.</p>

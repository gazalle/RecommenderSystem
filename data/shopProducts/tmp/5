aiken (120) marine,tailored <p>The marine-blue Aiken dress is a detailed take on a workwear classic. It's cut to sit slim against the body with a high, straight neckline and it has an artful folded neckline detail that gives it an edge. Wear it with black heels and carry a structured tote for a polished workwear look.</p>

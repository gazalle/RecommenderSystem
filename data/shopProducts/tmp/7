Cohen (54) dusky pink,ruffle-front <p>The Cohen dress is a feminine take on a classic shift silhoeutte, cut from dusky-pink chiffon with a decorative ruffled front feature and a soft high neckline. Ideal for any high-summer event, it's best suited to minimalistic accessories; strappy sandals and a boxy clutch work best.</p>
